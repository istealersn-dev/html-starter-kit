<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

(blob:https://vercel.com/704ac3bd-1d76-4716-8d5b-5d2a88c4a6f3)

This was an interesting project when I began the development. Another attempt to successfully develop responsive landing page with just HTML and SCSS alone.

- You can use the following link to review the page: https://edie-homepage-dev-io.vercel.app/
- Amazing experience especially full bleed image vs the rest of the items on the page
- Learned a bit more SaSS (mixins, functions, map, etc.)
- Love doing such projects

### Built With

This page has been purely built using HTML5 and SaSS. I have also implemented 7-in-1 Sass architecture as part of this project
